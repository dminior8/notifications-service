## Overview
The Notifications Service is a Spring Boot application that allows for publishing notifications to various channels. It uses a message queue (such as RabbitMQ or Kafka) to send messages to subscribed consumers. The service can handle different types of notifications and sends them based on the configured channels.

## Technologies Used
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven
- Docker
- RabbitMQ (for messaging)

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 21 (JDK 21)
- Maven 3.8.x or higher
- Docker (for containerization)

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dminior8/NotificationsMQ.git
```
```bash
cd notifications-service
```

### Install dependencies
To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```
This will download and install all the necessary dependencies for the application.

Sometimes, when this issue occurs, you may need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable by running in PowerShell command:

```bash
$env:JAVA_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21"
```

## Building and Running the Application
This project includes a Dockerfile to build and run the application within a Docker container. To build and run the container:

### Running with Docker

Make sure Maven Wrapper is available in your repo. Check if the following file exists:
````
.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
````

If it doesnâ€™t exist, generate the wrapper:
```bash
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
```

This creates:
`.mvn/wrapper/` with required files`


#### Build Docker image
```bash
docker build -t notifications-service .
```

#### Running Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
The application will now be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
The RabbitMQ Management will now be accessible at http://localhost:15672/.
